first of all, i think you guys did a good job. the videos and articles were impactful. most of the time, it made me want to learn more on a particular subject that my roommate had to remind me that i had a deadline. the recources for futher learning, especially for command prompt, is something i would still look into. trying out the command line codes made me feel like a code ninja, even though am not yet. learning to create, check out, move, copy and rewrite files and directories was awesome. the nine short youtube videos tutorial was nice. already suscribed to the channel. i think i would be watching a bit more of that dudes videos. Also learnt of stuffs on the command line like how to check the diferent ways commands can be combined and used as well as how to change the background and text(foreground) in command prompt. never knew those could be changed, and am wondering why programmmers don't change the color. maybe it's becuase it makes them look cool. i personnally think the color is dull though. github was a bit confusing, but someone put me through. after his explanation and the 30mins video on how to setup github, the rest was mostly easy, and i wasn't among the earliest to complete the tasks, so i cuaght the correction to the error that most people were making on slack before i begun. the meduim article is still under construction and am still reading up on the terms and documentation for github. all these "fork" and "repo" still confuses me.
